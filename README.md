# MSY-scraper

MSY-scraper is a Python project for scraping data from the MSY website.

## Installation

This project uses Anaconda for managing the Python environment and dependencies. To set up the project:

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in a terminal.
4. Create a new Anaconda environment from the `environment.yml` file with the command:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

5. Activate the new environment with the command:

```bash
conda activate PY312Scraper
```

## Usage

Once you've set up the project, you can run the scraper with the command:

```bash
python src/scraper.py
```

This will scrape data from the MSY website and save it in the `data` directory.

Please replace PY312Scraper with the actual name of your Anaconda environment, and adjust the other sections as necessary to fit your project.
